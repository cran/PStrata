\arguments{
\item{file}{
    The path to the Stan program to use. 
    \code{file} should be a character string file name or a connection that 
    \R supports containing the text of a model specification in the Stan 
    modeling language. 
    
    A model may also be specified directly as a character string using the 
    \code{model_code} argument, but we recommend always putting Stan programs 
    in separate files with a \code{.stan} extension.
    
    The \code{stan} function can also use the Stan program from an existing
    \code{stanfit} object via the \code{fit} argument. When \code{fit} is 
    specified, the \code{file} argument is ignored.
    }

\item{model_name}{
    A string to use as the name of the model; defaults 
    to \code{"anon_model"}. However, the model name will be derived from 
    \code{file} or \code{model_code} (if \code{model_code} is the name
    of a character string object) if \code{model_name} is not specified.
    This is not a particularly important argument, although since it 
    affects the name used in printed messages, developers of other packages 
    that use \pkg{rstan} to fit models may want to use informative names.
  }

\item{model_code}{
    A character string either containing the model definition or the name of 
    a character string object in the workspace. This argument is used only 
    if arguments \code{file} and \code{fit} are not specified.
  }

\item{fit}{
    An instance of S4 class \code{stanfit} derived from a previous fit;
    defaults to \code{NA}. If \code{fit} is not \code{NA}, the compiled model 
    associated with the fitted result is re-used; thus the time that would 
    otherwise be spent recompiling the C++ code for the model can be saved.
  }

\item{data}{A named \code{list} or \code{environment} providing the data for 
    the model, or a character vector for all the names of objects to use as data. 
    See the \strong{Passing data to Stan} section below.}

\item{pars}{A character vector specifying parameters of interest to be saved. 
    The default is to save all parameters from the model. 
    If \code{include = TRUE}, only samples for parameters named in \code{pars} 
    are stored in the fitted results. Conversely, if \code{include = FALSE}, 
    samples for all parameters \emph{except} those named in \code{pars} are 
    stored in the fitted results.}

\item{chains}{A positive integer specifying the number of Markov chains. 
    The default is 4.}

\item{iter}{A positive integer specifying the number of iterations for each 
    chain (including warmup). The default is 2000.}

\item{warmup}{A positive integer specifying the number of warmup (aka burnin)
    iterations per chain. If step-size adaptation is on (which it is by default), 
    this also controls the number of iterations for which adaptation is run (and
    hence these warmup samples should not be used for inference). The number of 
    warmup iterations should be smaller than \code{iter} and the default is
    \code{iter/2}.}

\item{thin}{A positive integer specifying the period for saving samples. 
    The default is 1, which is usually the recommended value. Unless your
    posterior distribution takes up too much memory we do \emph{not} recommend 
    thinning as it throws away information. The tradition of thinning when 
    running MCMC stems primarily from the use of samplers that require 
    a large number of iterations to achieve the desired effective sample size. 
    Because of the efficiency (effective samples per second) of 
    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, rarely should this be necessary when using Stan.}

\item{init}{
    Specification of initial values for all or some parameters.
    Can be the digit \code{0}, the strings \code{"0"} or \code{"random"}, 
    a function that returns a named list, or a list of named lists:
    \describe{
    \item{\code{init="random"} (default):}{Let Stan generate random initial values
      for all parameters. The seed of the random number generator used by Stan 
      can be specified via the \code{seed} argument. If the seed for Stan is 
      fixed, the same initial values are used. The default is to randomly 
      generate initial values between \code{-2} and \code{2} \emph{on the 
      unconstrained support}. The optional additional parameter \code{init_r} can 
      be set to some value other than \code{2} to change the range of the randomly 
      generated inits.}
    \item{\code{init="0", init=0}:}{Initialize all parameters to zero on 
      the unconstrained support.}  
    \item{inits via list:}{Set inital values by providing a list 
      equal in length to the number of chains. The elements of this list should 
      themselves be named lists, where each of these named lists has the name 
      of a parameter and is used to specify the initial values for that parameter 
      for the corresponding chain.}
    \item{inits via function:}{Set initial values by providing a function that 
      returns a list for specifying the initial values of parameters for a chain. 
      The function can take an optional parameter \code{chain_id} through which the 
      \code{chain_id} (if specified) or the integers from 1 to \code{chains} will be 
      supplied to the function for generating initial values.
      See the \strong{Examples} section below for examples of defining 
      such functions and using a list of lists for specifying initial values.}
    }
    When specifying initial values via a \code{list} or \code{function}, any
    parameters for which values are not specified will receive initial values
    generated as described in the \code{init="random"} description above.
  }

\item{seed}{The seed for random number generation. The default is generated 
    from 1 to the maximum integer supported by \R on the machine. Even if 
    multiple chains are used, only one seed is needed, with other chains having 
    seeds derived from that of the first chain to avoid dependent samples.
    When a seed is specified by a number, \code{as.integer} will be applied to it. 
    If \code{as.integer} produces \code{NA}, the seed is generated randomly. 
    The seed can also be specified as a character string of digits, such as
    \code{"12345"}, which is converted to integer.
    
    Using \R's \code{set.seed} function to set the seed for Stan will not work.
    }

\item{algorithm}{
    One of the sampling algorithms that are implemented in Stan. 
    The default and preferred algorithm is \code{"NUTS"}, which is 
    the No-U-Turn sampler variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    (Hoffman and Gelman 2011, Betancourt 2017). Currently the other options 
    are \code{"HMC"} (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo), and \code{"Fixed_param"}. 
    When \code{"Fixed_param"} is used no MCMC sampling is performed 
    (e.g., for simulating with in the generated quantities block).
  }

\item{control}{A named \code{list} of parameters to control the sampler's
    behavior. It defaults to \code{NULL} so all the default values are used. 
    First, the following are adaptation parameters for sampling algorithms.
    These are parameters used in Stan with similar names here.
    \itemize{
      \item \code{adapt_engaged} (\code{logical})
      \item \code{adapt_gamma} (\code{double}, positive, defaults to 0.05)
      \item \code{adapt_delta} (\code{double}, between 0 and 1, defaults to 0.8)
      \item \code{adapt_kappa} (\code{double}, positive, defaults to 0.75)
      \item \code{adapt_t0} (\code{double}, positive, defaults to 10)
      \item \code{adapt_init_buffer} (\code{integer}, positive, defaults to 75)
      \item \code{adapt_term_buffer} (\code{integer}, positive, defaults to 50)
      \item \code{adapt_window} (\code{integer}, positive, defaults to 25)
    }

    In addition, algorithm HMC (called 'static HMC' in Stan) and NUTS share the
    following parameters:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{stepsize} (\code{double}, positive)
      \item \code{stepsize_jitter} (\code{double}, [0,1])
      \item \code{metric} (\code{string}, one of "unit_e", "diag_e", "dense_e")
    }
    For algorithm NUTS, we can also set:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{max_treedepth} (\code{integer}, positive)
    }
    For algorithm HMC, we can also set:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{int_time} (\code{double}, positive)
    }
    
    For \code{test_grad} mode, the following parameters can be set:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{epsilon} (\code{double}, defaults to 1e-6)
      \item \code{error} (\code{double}, defaults to 1e-6)
    }
  }

\item{sample_file}{An optional character string providing the name of a file.
    If specified the draws for \emph{all} parameters and other saved quantities
    will be written to the file. If not provided, files are not created. 
    When the folder specified is not writable, \code{tempdir()} is used. 
    When there are multiple chains, an underscore and chain number are appended
    to the file name.}

\item{diagnostic_file}{An optional character string providing the name of a file.
    If specified the diagnostics data for \emph{all} parameters will be written
    to the file. If not provided, files are not created. When the folder specified 
    is not writable, \code{tempdir()} is used. When there are multiple chains, 
    an underscore and chain number are appended to the file name.}

\item{save_dso}{Logical, with default \code{TRUE}, indicating whether the 
    dynamic shared object (DSO) compiled from the C++ code for the model 
    will be saved or not. If \code{TRUE}, we can draw samples from
    the same model in another \R session using the saved DSO (i.e., 
    without compiling the C++ code again).
    This parameter only takes effect if \code{fit} is not used; with  
    \code{fit} defined, the DSO from the previous run is used.
    When \code{save_dso=TRUE}, the fitted object can be loaded from 
    what is saved previously and used for sampling, if the compiling is
    done on the same platform, that is, same operating system and same 
    architecture (32bits or 64bits).}

\item{verbose}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}: flag indicating whether 
    to print intermediate output from Stan on the console, which might
    be helpful for model debugging.}

\item{include}{Logical scalar defaulting to \code{TRUE} indicating
    whether to include or exclude the parameters given by the 
    \code{pars} argument. If \code{FALSE}, only entire multidimensional
    parameters can be excluded, rather than particular elements of them.}

\item{cores}{
    The number of cores to use when executing the Markov chains in parallel.
    The default is to use the value of the \code{"mc.cores"} option if it 
    has been set and otherwise to default to 1 core. However, we recommend 
    setting it to be as many processors as the hardware and RAM allow 
    (up to the number of chains). See \code{\link[parallel]{detectCores}} 
    if you don't know this number for your system.
  }

\item{open_progress}{Logical scalar that only takes effect if 
    \code{cores > 1} but is recommended to be \code{TRUE} in interactive
    use so that the progress of the chains will be redirected to a file
    that is automatically opened for inspection. For very short runs, the
    user might prefer \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Other optional parameters: 
    \itemize{
      \item \code{chain_id} (\code{integer})
      \item \code{init_r} (\code{double}, positive)
      \item \code{test_grad} (\code{logical})
      \item \code{append_samples} (\code{logical})
      \item \code{refresh}(\code{integer})
      \item \code{save_warmup}(\code{logical})
      \item deprecated: \code{enable_random_init}(\code{logical}) 
    }

    \code{chain_id} can be a vector to specify the chain_id for all 
    chains or an integer. For the former case, they should be unique. 
    For the latter, the sequence of integers starting from the given
    \code{chain_id} are used for all chains. 

    \code{init_r} is used only for generating random initial values,
    specifically when \code{init="random"} or not all parameters
    are initialized in the user-supplied list or function. If specified, 
    the initial values are simulated uniformly from interval 
    [-\code{init_r}, \code{init_r}] rather than using the default interval 
    (see the manual of (cmd)Stan).
    
    \code{test_grad} (\code{logical}).  
    If \code{test_grad=TRUE}, Stan will not do any sampling. Instead,
    the gradient calculation is tested and printed out and the fitted
    \code{stanfit} object is in test gradient mode.  By default, it is
    \code{FALSE}.
    
    \code{append_samples} (\code{logical}). 
    Only relevant if \code{sample_file} is specified \emph{and} is an 
    existing file. In that case, setting \code{append_samples=TRUE} will append 
    the samples to the existing file rather than overwriting the contents of 
    the file.

    \code{refresh} (\code{integer}) can be used to
    control how often the progress of the sampling is reported (i.e. 
    show the progress every \code{refresh} iterations). 
    By default, \code{refresh = max(iter/10, 1)}. 
    The progress indicator is turned off if \code{refresh <= 0}.

    Deprecated: \code{enable_random_init} (\code{logical}) being \code{TRUE}
    enables specifying initial values randomly when the initial
    values are not fully specified from the user. 
    
    \code{save_warmup} (\code{logical}) indicates whether to 
    save draws during the warmup phase and defaults to \code{TRUE}. Some
    memory related problems can be avoided by setting it to \code{FALSE},
    but some diagnostics are more limited if the warmup draws are not
    stored.

    to use instead of the one in the \pkg{BH} package.}

     library to the one in \pkg{RcppEigen}.}
